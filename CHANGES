* 0.2.1.0

  on older GHC).

  Allowed use of blaze-builder 0.4.

* 0.2.0.5

  Widened dependency on bytestring to allow for bytestring-0.10

* 0.2.0.4

* 0.2.0.3

  Changed licence to BSD3

* 0.2.0.2

  Widened blaze-builder dependencies.

* 0.2.0.1

  Removed left-over flag -fno-warn-unused-binds in .cabal file to allow
  blaze-builder-enumerator to be built with GHC 6.10.

* 0.2.0.0

  An enumeratee that allows to incrementally execute builders and pass-on the
  produced bytestrings to an inner iteratee.

  Complete rewrite by Simon Meier <iridcode@gmail.com> merging the builder
  enumeratee code by Michael Snoyman <michael@snoyman.com> with the new
  buffered output support provided by blaze-builder-0.2.1.0.
